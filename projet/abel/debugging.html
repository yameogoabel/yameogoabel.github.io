	  <p>Burkina Faso, landlocked country in western Africa. The country occupies an extensive plateau, and its 
	  geography is characterized by a savanna that is grassy in the north and gradually gives way to sparse forests
	  in the south.</p><br>
	 <p> A former French colony, it gained independence as Upper Volta in 1960. The name Burkina Faso, which means
	 “Land of Incorruptible People,” was adopted in 1984. The capital, Ouagadougou, is in the centre of the country 
	 and lies about 500 miles (800 km) from the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
	  <p>Burkina Faso is bounded by Mali to the north and west, Niger to the northeast, Benin to the southeast,
	  and Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo to the south.</p>

	  <p>Citizens of Burkina Faso, regardless of their ethnic origin, are collectively known as Burkinabé. French is 
	  the official language, although it is not widely spoken. Moore, the language of the Mossi, is spoken by a great 
	  majority of the population, and Dyula is widely used in commerce.</p> <br>
	  <p>Upper Volta first sent an Olympic team to the 1972 Munich Games, although the first athletes from Upper Volta
	  to participate in the Olympics were two javelin throwers who competed in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics as members of
	  the French team. The country’s first participation in the Olympics as Burkina Faso was in the 1988 Seoul Games.</p>

      <h3>European exploration and colonization</h3>
      <p>The German explorer Gottlob Adolf Krause traversed the Mossi country in 1886, and the French army officer 
	  Louis-Gustave Binger visited the morho naba in 1888. France obtained a protectorate over the Yatenga empire in 1895,
	  and the French officers Paul Voulet and Charles Paul Louis Chanoine (also known as Julien Chanoine) defeated the
	  morho naba Boukari-Koutou (Wobogo) of Mossi in 1896 and then proceeded to overrun the Gurunsi lands. The Gurma accepted 
	  a French protectorate in 1897, and in that same year the lands of the Bobo and of the Lobi were annexed by the French 
	  (though the Lobi, armed with poisoned arrows, were not effectively subdued until 1903). An Anglo-French convention of 1
	  898 fixed the frontier between France’s new acquisitions and the northern territories of the Gold Coast.</p><br><br>

      <p>The French divided the country into administrative cercles (“circles”) but maintained the chiefs, including the morho naba, 
      in their traditional seats. The country at first was attached to Upper Senegal–Niger (as that colony was called from 1904 to 1920; now Mali)
       but was organized as a separate colony, Upper Volta (Haute-Volta), in 1919. In 1932 it was partitioned between Côte d’Ivoire, Niger, and French Sudan.
       In 1947, however, Upper Volta was reestablished to become an overseas territory of the French Union, with a territorial assembly of its own.
       The assembly in 1957 received the right to elect an executive council of government for the territory, which at the end of 1958 was transformed into
        an autonomous republic within the French Community. When independence was proclaimed on August 5, 1960, the new constitution provided for an
      executive president elected by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term and an elected</p>
